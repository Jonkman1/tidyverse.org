<!--Every package release should include the following standard text-->

Weâ€™re {exceedingly happy} to announce the release of {pkgname} {pkgversion} on CRAN. The goal of the {pkgname} package is to...

You can install {pkgname} with:

```{r install-pkg, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("{pkgname}") # insert pkgname here
```

Attach the package by running:

```{r use-pkg}
library({pkgname}) # insert pkgname here
```


## Acknowledgements

<!--Every package release should include an acknowledgements section individually thanks every major contributor, and collectively thanks all GitHub contributors. You can use `usethis::use_tidy_thanks()` to get all contributors to a package in a time interval and paste this into your post. Examples:
-->

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# to use, set eval = TRUE
library(usethis)
use_tidy_thanks("OWNER/REPO") ## default: interval = since the last release
use_tidy_thanks("OWNER/REPO", from = "2018-05-01")
use_tidy_thanks("OWNER/REPO", from = "v1.3.0")
```
